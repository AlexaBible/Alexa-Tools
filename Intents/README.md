# Intents

This folder contains a PHP script and a JSON file. Each has a representation of the built-in intents that 
Amazon provide. The JSON file has been created from the output of the json_decode() PHP function and comes 
directly from the supplied PHP script.

The following is the todo list for intents:

* [ ] Include every slot available and position these within the relevant intents.
* [ ] Review the format of the JSON to ensure that it is optimal and fit for purpose.
